# Get & Update Random Number smart contract on Ethereum

- A simple js app which updates a random number on click and prints the same on clicking print button. All the transactions happen on the blockchain.
- This app contains all the essential boilerplate code for those who want to initialize a web3 frontend from a deployed contract.
- Works as on August, 2021. I was frustrated to access smart contract methods from the front end due to the recent changes in MetaMask API / Web3.js library. Finally, this works!
